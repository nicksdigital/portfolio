# LayerBlog

## Project Overview

LayerBlog revolutionizes the digital content experience by giving readers control over information depth and providing authors with unprecedented insight into reader engagement. Unlike traditional blogging platforms where all content is presented at the same level of detail, LayerBlog organizes content into distinct layers that users can navigate based on their interest and available time.

## Key Features

### Multi-Layered Content Architecture

Content is organized into four distinct but interconnected layers:

- **Headline Layer**: Key points and main takeaways - perfect for quick scanning
- **Context Layer**: Background information and explanatory content
- **Detail Layer**: In-depth analysis and technical details
- **Discussion Layer**: Community insights and author responses

This architecture allows readers to progressively explore content at their own pace, starting with essential information and diving deeper as needed.

### Contextual Engagement Tools

LayerBlog transforms passive reading into active engagement:

- **Text-Level Appreciation**: Readers can "clap" for specific passages they find valuable
- **Contextual Annotations**: Add notes to specific text sections for personal reference or sharing
- **Explanation Requests**: Request additional context for complex concepts
- **Visual Engagement Metrics**: Heat maps showing which passages resonate most with readers

### Advanced UX Design

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is revealed based on reader intent
- **Selection Tools**: Enhanced text selection with contextual options
- **Ambient Controls**: Interface elements that appear when needed and fade when not
- **Visual Transitions**: Smooth animations between content layers for spatial context

### Author Analytics

Authors gain valuable insights into how readers interact with their content:

- **Engagement Heat Maps**: Visual representation of which content sections receive most attention
- **Layer Transition Analysis**: Understanding how readers move through content depths
- **Time-on-Layer Metrics**: Data on how long readers spend at each content depth
- **Contextual Feedback**: Direct insight into which passages readers appreciate or find confusing

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Framer Motion
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS Variables for theming
- **State Management**: Context API, custom hooks
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for content, Redis for real-time features
- **Real-time Features**: WebSockets for live updates

## Current Status

LayerBlog is currently in active development with key components functioning:

- Layer toggling and content organization
